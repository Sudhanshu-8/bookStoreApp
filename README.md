# Welcome to the Bookstore App ðŸ“š

This is a feature-rich Bookstore App built using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Axios for seamless interaction between the client and server.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in with secure authentication.
- **Book Management**: Add, update, and delete books.
- **Search & Filter**: Easily find books using search functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly user interface.
- **RESTful API**: Backend API for managing books and users.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookstore-app.git
   cd bookstore-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # For backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # For frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
     ```bash
     PORT=4001
     MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
     ```
   - Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` and `your_jwt_secret_key` with your values.

4. Start the app:

   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm start

   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

## How It Works

- **Frontend**: Built with React and styled using CSS frameworks for a smooth user experience.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express, providing secure and efficient APIs.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing book and user data.
- **Axios**: For seamless communication between the client and server.
